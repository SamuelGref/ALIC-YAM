  <h3>THE GOOD NEWS</h3>
  <P>The good news is that no matter who we are, where we are from, or what we have done, we are all supernaturally loved by God and wonderfully made in His image. The bad news is that we have all turned away from God; we have all chosen our ways
    over His ways, and we are separated from God, evident in all sorts of suffering we experience in this world. But the best news is that God has not left us alone in our separation. God has come to us in the person of Jesus, and He has made a way
    for every single one of us to be restored to a relationship with God not just in this world, but for all of eternity. There is no better news than this!</P>
